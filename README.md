## A2 Group 58 - Assignment 3

### Project Idea


### Topic
Our team intends to investigate the project scope of establishing a virtual and augmented events company targeting disabled persons that cannot attend a particular function due to their disability.

The outcomes of this project would be to provide our team with an understanding of the technologies and tools required to establish such an organisation and gain an understanding of what current products are available in the marketplace.

### Motivation 
VR a AR are two of the leading technologies currently underdevelopment in our modern world. Gaining an insight into this is motivating for all our team members as we can bolster our knowledge of current trends, tools and technologies. The project shows that we are not afraid to step into the unknown and cutting edge technologies.

We are also focusing our project towards assisting those with disabilities to bridge the gap in specific experiences that they cannot have compared to an abled body person.

### Landscape
Researching we have found that there are some VR events companies are available in industries such as arts and sport but none specifically enabling the disabled to attend and interact at events. We have identified this as an area of weakness within the AR/VR Live Events field, and believe its a potential area that can benefit society and better individuals lives.



## Project Plans and Progress

Our plans started after we received some poor feedback for our assignment 2 project idea. We were told that we lacked proper scoping, analysis and testing of the idea, meaning that we did not pick up on some serious flaws with the project idea from top to bottom. We knew that if we were to succeed for Assignment 3 we needed to go back to the drawing board as a group. 

We decided that each team member was to provide 3 new project ideas for a group brainstorming session. In this brainstorming session we ran through each idea in detail and asked as many questions we could to see which would be best suited for Assignment 3. After a very beneficial and long session we decided that one of Stevens idea’s was going to be our new project idea for Assignment 3. This project idea was a VR/AR Program that will allow people with disabilities to attend live events.

After the major downfalls that we had in Assignment 2, we knew that we needed to scope out this project at Industry level details, really focusing on the following areas when project planning; 

### Technical Implementation 
- Work through UX & UI at a high level to ensure the project is functional for users
- QA & Testing Process’

### How does the project work?

Our project will allow people with disabilities to view their favourite artist, stand up comedian, motivational speaker, and many other live acts from the front row, middle of the mosh pit or even seated at the back of the venue. 

Although there are millions of venues around the world that cater amazingly for people with disabilities, allowing them smooth access into & out of the building with excellent seating arrangements, we are still years and years away from having 100% accessibility to all venues. 

To go along with that, when an abled body individual purchase their ticket for an event they can choose to be in the mosh pit, be back right seated, be level two seated front row in the middle, they get the liberty of being able to sit almost wherever they want within their price range, in which a disabled person has a couple of set areas they must sit in, a lot less choice & area of seats.

What our product will be providing is a way that people with disabilities will be able to view an event from close to any seat in the venue via either AR or VR depending on what they tech they have access to. 

We will capture live shows using both 360-degree camera & top-line recording devices. These units will be positioned in multiple different positions at each event, so we are able to provide a variety of seating/viewing options for what the user desires. 


### What are we trying to achieve?

Our project's key aims will be to allow people with disabilities to view and experience events like they never have before. 

Our product will help tackle a lot of key barriers that most people with disabilities face while trying to attend an event; 

- Venue accessibility 
- Venue seating capabilities
- Travel capabilities & resource

Although our product is aiming at assisting people with disabilities to experience events, we understand that it will also be suited to people who face other social, physical and mental barriers when attending a live event, such barriers like

- Dislike for crowds 
- Freedom to dance & Sing without judgement 

Our product aims to change event viewing experience completely. We will provide a couple of varying levels of viewing solutions for every user, from the ability to use your smartphone with a pre owned VR/AR headset, all the way to a fully fitted VR headset. 

### Project Attack

We followed the following project steps to achieve completing our assignment on time and to a high standard we were happy with. 

1. Project Brainstorm Session
2. Project Decision
3. Project Idea Analysis 
4. Project Storyboard
5. Set Project timeline & key dates
6. Delegated roles & project areas 
7. Tracked progress with weekly meetings, and progress reviews. 
8. Completed version 1 of assignment early to focus on reviewing and cleaning up all errors. 
9. Submitted Final Assignment




## Scope and Limits
The scope of our project is limited to planning only and no working examples will be available as unfortunately the majority of our group members are early in their learning for this course and lack the skills to display progress in coding. Our project scope is to provide;

A fully detailed table detailing all latest technologies, tools and skills required to execute and complete our AR/VR.
Flow diagram of generalised functionality
A fully detailed timing timeline with all aspects of the AR/VR project considered.
